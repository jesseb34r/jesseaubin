# About these notes

This is a curated collection of my working notes that I am sharing because I want to "work with the garage door up".

These notes have no search function or defined organizational structure by design (seeÂ [[Let form be emergent]]). Instead, navigate through exploring through the network of links.

Be sure to check back from time to time as these notes are a living work. A huge part of this process is editing and connecting ideas so the information in each note changes over time.

Good places to get started:

- [[Now]]
- [[Why I write]]
- [[How to take notes]]
